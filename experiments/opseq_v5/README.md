# Topo-Carving

**Discovering surface topology from multi-view silhouettes — with guaranteed-manifold operators.**

Most differentiable mesh reconstruction assumes the topology (a template with the right number of
holes) and only preserves it. **Topo-Carving discovers the genus from the images**: a space-carving
oracle tells the optimizer *how many* tunnels the shape has and *where* they are, and every topology
change is executed as a TopMod **DLFL `add_handle`** — so the mesh is a valid orientable 2-manifold,
watertight, after **every** step, and the genus can never drift silently.

## Highlights (golden v6.5)

> **Status (2026-10-03, golden v6.5): strict surface topology.** Genus is only a count. v6.5 checks that the
> mesh surface *realises every tunnel of the carved hull*: a GT-free audit computes linking numbers between the
> mesh's handle loops and closed curves through the hull's tunnels
> ([`linking_audit.py`](despike/linking_audit.py)). Under this audit v6.4 had the right
> genus in every run but on fertility only 6/21 runs had the right surface (one tunnel was open only through
> interpenetrating parts, the fourth handle was a hidden micro-handle). v6.2/v6.3 results are withdrawn
> (bridge bug); v6.4 numbers are genus-count statements.

- **Strict topology, five shapes**: fertility (genus 4), threeholes (3), kitten (1), rockerarm (1), armadillo (0):
  **15/15 runs** with the right genus *and* every hull tunnel realised by a surface handle; fertility alone
  16/16 with the final rules (v6.4: 6/21). See
  [`GOLDEN.md`](despike/results64v/GOLDEN.md) v6.5.
- **How**: handles that realise no tunnel (micro-handles) are removed on the refined mesh; missing ones are added
  by a 2-second near-pair detector and accepted only if the number of realised tunnels goes up by exactly one;
  the mesh is re-audited after the final refine.
- **No time tail**: 4-9 min per chain on an RTX 5090 (v6.4: median 5.5 min on fertility, worst case 25 min).
- **Count-first propose-and-verify** and **hull-guided completion** still drive the coarse discovery stage.
- **Botijo (genus 5)**, a model used by competing work: genus discovered, 5/5 tunnels realised, volume IoU
  **0.996-0.998**, same parameters as every other shape.
- **Every topology change is a DLFL operator**: `add_handle` to open or join, the new `remove_handle` (its exact
  inverse, built from `delete_edge` + `stellate`) to delete a handle that realises no tunnel.
- **Knows when it does not apply**: an oracle check refuses shapes whose hull topology does not settle (thin-walled
  heptoroid) instead of returning a broken mesh.
- Held-out silhouette IoU **0.9972** on armadillo (DMesh plateaus at 0.989), volume IoU **0.992** on fertility.

## What `add_handle` actually does

TopMod's `add_handle(f1, f2)` deletes two faces and stitches their boundary loops together with a ring
of new side quads — a tube. Applied to the two pages of a thin membrane, it **drills a through-hole**:

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_add_handle_donut.png" width="980" alt="add_handle on a membrane donut"/>
</p>

A donut whose hole is covered by a thin membrane is genus 0 (panels 1–2). `add_handle` on the
membrane's top face (red) and bottom face (blue) deletes both and joins their rims with 20 side quads
(orange, panel 4) — the tube wall; inside the tube is air, so the genus becomes 1 (panel 3). In the
pipeline, DLFL collapses then absorb the leftover membrane and the hole grows to the real tunnel
(panel 5). Real TopMod output, reproducible with
[`demo_add_handle_donut.py`](despike/demo_add_handle_donut.py).
If the two faces had **air** between them instead of membrane material, the same operator would build
a *bridge* instead of drilling a hole — still genus +1, but a wrong tunnel. Keeping `add_handle` fed
with genuine membranes is exactly what the propose-and-verify gate is for.

## How it works

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_pipeline.png" width="920" alt="pipeline"/>
</p>

**1 — Carve the oracle.** A voting visual hull is carved from the input silhouettes once. Its Euler
number gives the tunnel **count** g\* (morphological closing ladder, mode over radii); a
closing-ladder plug analysis gives each tunnel's **location** on demand.

**2 — See the membranes.** Faces whose interior samples sit in hull *air* are membranes blocking a
tunnel — the orange patches below are literally what the detector proposes to open:

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_oracle_membranes_plugs.png" width="560" alt="oracle: membranes + tunnel plugs"/>
</p>

**3 — Propose-and-verify every handle.** Each membrane pair becomes a DLFL `add_handle` (manifold by
construction), kept only if a count-first gate and a differentiable-render check agree. The loop
stops exactly at g\*. When the refined mesh hugs the hull and membranes vanish, the oracle's plug
locations take over (hull-guided completion).

**4 — TopMod operators run the whole pipeline, not just the topology step.** `add_handle` is the
only *genus-changing* operator; everything else is topology-preserving TopMod machinery:

| stage | TopMod operators at work |
|---|---|
| init | `make_icosahedron`, `catmull_clark` (coarse-to-fine levels) |
| carve to hull (DR loop) | `flip`, `collapse_edge_tri` (link-condition guarded) |
| genus discovery | `insert_edge`/`delete_edge` (merge a membrane into one rim polygon), `subdivide_edge` (rim alignment), **`add_handle`** (genus +1, DR-verified) |
| refine | `catmull_clark`, `subdivide_edge`, `collapse_edge_tri`, `flip` — driven by a Palfinger-style adaptive schedule, executed as DLFL ops |
| strict repair + late pass | **`remove_handle`** (`delete_edge` on the band's spokes + `stellate`; genus −1), **`add_handle`** for joins (genus +1, rank-verified) |
| final | Taubin smoothing (vertex positions only — topology untouched) |

Because every one of these preserves the DLFL invariants, the mesh is manifold + watertight after
**every** step, and the genus can only change at a verified `add_handle` — robustness **by
construction**, not by a regularizer.

**5 — Audit the topology, not just the genus.** A mesh can have the right genus and still be wrong: one tunnel
open only because two parts interpenetrate, plus a hidden triangle-sized handle that makes up the count. The audit
builds one closed curve through each tunnel of the carved hull (left, middle) and computes the linking number of
every handle loop of the mesh with every such curve (right). The rank of that matrix is the number of tunnels the
surface really has. No ground truth involved.

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_linking_audit.png" width="980" alt="linking-number audit"/>
</p>

Under this audit the previous version (v6.4) had the right genus in 27/27 runs but the right surface in only 6/21
on fertility. v6.5 repairs it on the refined mesh: handles that link no tunnel are removed with `remove_handle`,
missing ones are added where two sheets meet and kept only if the rank goes up by exactly one; the mesh is audited
again after the last refinement.

## Where it does not work

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_heptoroid_limit.png" width="860" alt="heptoroid: ground truth vs visual hull"/>
<br/><i>Heptoroid (genus 22): a thin saddle surface. Top: ground truth. Bottom: the visual hull from 64 silhouettes.</i>
</p>

The method reads topology off a hull carved from silhouettes. A thin curved wall hides its concave side from every
view, so the hull fills it: on heptoroid the hull has 1.9x the object's volume and a genus that does not settle
(40 / 31 / 44 for three closing radii; the truth is 22). More voxels do not help (256³ → 512³: no change); sharper
silhouette edges and 1-vote carving bring the excess down to 1.26x, not to a usable oracle; giving the true genus
does not help either, because the locations come from the hull. The oracle check detects this from the silhouettes
alone and refuses the shape. Other open problems (fake handles are repaired rather than prevented, joins happen
late, self-intersections, real captures) are listed in
[`ALGORITHM.md`](despike/ALGORITHM.md#9-known-problems-and-limits).

## Comparison with prior work

| Method | topology source | discovers genus? | manifold guarantee | genus drift possible? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nicolet et al. (Large Steps) | fixed input mesh | no | no | yes (handle collapse) |
| Gu et al. (ICASSP 2026) | template (count + rough location) | no | no | patched via PH prior |
| DMesh | implicit (existence probs) | partially | no (self-prunes) | yes |
| Palfinger | fixed | no | remesh-based | yes |
| **Topo-Carving (ours)** | **discovered from the carved hull** | **yes** | **by construction (DLFL)** | **impossible by construction** |

<p align="center">
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_dmesh_compare.png" width="480" alt="DMesh comparison"/>
<img src="despike/results_genus/fig_ablation.png" width="440" alt="ablation"/>
</p>

A note on numbers from the high-genus papers of Gao, Gu et al.: they give a template with the ground-truth genus,
define neither Chamfer distance nor volume IoU, and released no code; their Nicolet baseline is not reproducible
from the text (botijo: they report 0.46, the public Nicolet code gives 0.92 under our metric). We therefore
re-measure every baseline with one script ([`eval_cd_iou.py`](despike/eval_cd_iou.py)) and do
not place their table next to ours.

Ablation (fertility, GT genus 4, n=15 per config, after the fix): removing the oracle collapses
genus accuracy to **4/15** and fails in *both* directions (missed **and** spurious tunnels);
membrane-checked hull-guided completion lifts 11/15 → 14/15. The count-first gate *alone* shows no
measurable gain over the legacy threshold gate at n=15 (11/15 vs 13/15, within run-to-run noise) — an
earlier claim that it did was withdrawn after the fix. Full study:
[`GATE_DECISION_findings.md`](despike/GATE_DECISION_findings.md) — including
the honest negative result that a typed-decision language model is a coin flip at the decisive
geometric decision.

## The TopMod library underneath

The topology machinery is a pure-Python implementation of Dr. Ergun Akleman's **TopMod** DLFL mesh
system: **30 operators** (4 fundamental + 7 high-level incl. `add_handle` / `remove_handle` + 7 classic subdivision + 12 remeshing
schemes) with closed-form oracle tests, **100% differentiable** position maps (PyTorch), a
**Blender addon** (21 operators in Edit Mode), and an autoregressive mesh tokenizer. Zero required
dependencies for the core.
