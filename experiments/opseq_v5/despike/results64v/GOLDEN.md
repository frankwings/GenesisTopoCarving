# GOLDEN v6.1 (2026-09-17) — five shapes, tunnels located on the MESH (Boss's formulation) + propose-and-verify
**Chain**: `despike/golden_chain.sh` (renamed from golden_v3_chain.sh), run with `TAGP=v6n`. Same stages as v5/v6; Stage 3 / 5b now:
1. **Topology oracle** g* = persistent genus of the space-carved hull (unchanged, LESSONS 24).
2. **Membrane detection on the DR mesh** (`membrane_locate.py`, `DETECT=membrane`): the hull never intersects the object, so a
   mesh FACE whose interior samples lie > 2 voxels outside the hull spans air = a membrane / a mouth of an unopened chamber.
   Faces -> edge-connected patches (split by normal sign when both skins are pressed together). Patches are kept only if
   they sit on a voxel block of "mesh material in hull air" whose removal raises the mesh genus (k >= 1); two patches on the
   same block are paired iff the segment between their faces runs through hull air AND mesh interior -> `add_handle(fi, fj)`.
   No closing radius, no throat-vs-mouth ambiguity (closing seals at the narrowest cross-section, which is not the mouth of a
   multi-exit chamber - fertility's upper cavity has 3 exits + 1 opening, needing 3 handles).
3. **Verify** (`phase7_multi.sh`): one handle per round -> 400 DR steps -> accept iff held-out IoU +0.002 or hair -10 %; else
   revert and blacklist the pair. Stage 5b runs the same loop on the refined mesh (safety net).
4. Membranes are exempt from the hull-field loss in Stages 2/3/5 (`MEMB_EXEMPT=2`) so they stay visible until opened.
**Meshes**: `results_genus/<shape>_v6n_auto.npz` (fertility: `_v6n1/2/3`), handles in `handles_<shape>_v6n*.json`.

Fertility was the open problem: v6 (closing-ladder plugs) succeeded 1 run in 4 (handles landed inside the chamber, genus 4 but
tunnels unopened, VolIoU 0.84); v6.1 3/3 with every accepted handle DR-verified. Supersedes tag `golden-v6`. Tag: `golden-v6.1`.

# GOLDEN v6 (2026-09-15) — all five shapes, handles LOCATED by the space-carved hull (no rays), same chain otherwise
**Chain**: `despike/golden_v3_chain.sh` run with `TAGP=v6c`; identical to v5 except Stage 3 / 5b tunnel location now uses
`despike/hull_locate.py` (`DETECT=hull`, default) instead of ray casting. Ray detector kept only as a fallback — never triggered on the five shapes.
`hull_locate.py` (Boss's formulation): closing-radius ladder R=4..40 on the cleaned 128^3 voting hull; a genus drop at radius R
yields a sealing sheet (= essential increment component: removing it re-opens the tunnel); accepted plugs are FROZEN into the
closing source so later radii cannot re-claim them (structural mutual exclusion, fixes the threeholes double-plug); tunnel axis
from sheet shape (cylinder long axis / disk normal / skeleton centreline for S-shaped tunnels); the face pair comes from an
occupancy walk along the axis/centreline (out->in and in->out crossings -> nearest triangles) with the crossings required to lie
in hull air. Every handle is then added with the TopMod DLFL `add_handle` operator as before.
**Meshes**: `results_genus/<shape>_v6c_auto.npz` (Taubin) / `<shape>_v6c_raw.npz`; handles in `handles_<shape>_v6c.json` (source `hull` for all 9 handles).

\* wall measured while another 20-23 GB job shared the GPU; uncontended chain time is the v5 figure (4.3-5.6 min) — the hull locator itself is < 60 s / shape.
Scores equal v5 within 0.001 on every metric; genus 9/9 plugs = g* on all shapes, zero ray fallbacks, zero Stage-5b contact joins
(v5 fertility needed one). All watertight, SI 0 (fertility 0.1 %), hair 0. Unit test `test_hull_locate.py` 5/5 (< 60 s per shape).

# GOLDEN v5 (2026-09-14) — all five shapes, all-TopMod chain, genus discovered, C++ kernel + batched render
**Chain**: `despike/golden_v3_chain.sh` (defaults now `DLFL_BACKEND=cpp`, `RENDER_BATCH=1`, `C2F_SUBDIV=cc`), run with `TAGP=v5`.
Stages: sphere -> TopMod CC2/CC3 + DR | DLFL clean 400 | genus discovery (rays + space-carved-hull target g*) |
CC4 + despike | Palfinger-param loop 1200 | late genus pass (contact join) | LAP x3 loop 1200 | AUTO Taubin | exam.
Every topology change is a TopMod DLFL operator (C++ kernel, bit-identical to the Python reference).
**Meshes**: `results_genus/<shape>_v5_auto.npz` (Taubin) / `<shape>_v5_raw.npz`; handles in `handles_<shape>_v5.json`.

All watertight, SI 0 (fertility 0.2 %), hair 0. Fertility genus stable over 3 independent runs (4/4/4).
Competitors (same GPU): Palfinger 3.6 min armadillo (genus fixed), Nicolet 4.7-15.4 (genus 0 always), DMesh 12-20 (soup).
History: v4 (2026-09-13) = same algorithm on the Python backend (120 min/shape), kept as the equivalence reference.

# GOLDEN v3 (2026-09-08) — armadillo, same 64-view setup, Palfinger optimizer params on the DLFL loop
**Mesh**: `cow_armadillo_golden_v3.npz` (Taubin) / `cow_armadillo_golden_v3_raw.npz` (no Taubin) — V=49,795 F=99,586, watertight, genus 0, **SI 0 %**
**Exam**: ho16 **0.9983** (raw 0.9978), **VolIoU 0.9948** (raw 0.9943), CD 0.00620 — beats Palfinger 2022 original code (0.9965 / 0.9938 / 0.00678, 37.9k V) on all three; DMesh 0.9894 / 0.9634; Nicolet 0.9593 / 0.8985.
**Chain**: golden v2 pre-Taubin mesh (`cow_armadillo_p6_50k.npz`) + 1200 in-loop steps with
`ADAM_BETAS=0.8,0.8 PALF_LAP=0.02 PALF_CLIP=10 LR_EDGE=0.3 ADAPT_REMESH=1 ADAPT_MODE=velocity ADAPT_NU_GAIN=0.2 ADAPT_LMIN_PX=1.3 ADAPT_MAX_F=100000 ADAPT_SI_GATE=0.3 COLLAPSE_EVERY=50 FLIP_EVERY=25 COLLAPSE_RATIO=0.4 SI_PUSH=0.15` → AUTO Taubin (x2). Details: LESSONS 22.
**Caveat**: 49.8k V vs Palfinger 37.9k (+31 %); wall 71 min vs 3.6 min. Genus shapes not yet re-run with v3 params.

# GOLDEN v2 / v1 (2026-09-02..03) — kept below for the chain history

# GOLDEN — armadillo, 64 training views (DMesh mv-recon setup), pure GenesisTopmod

**Mesh**: `cow_armadillo_p5_64_taubin5.npz` (+ .obj) — V=18,253 F=36,502, watertight, genus 0
**Exam (16 held-out views)**: ho16 IoU **0.9957**, hair_px 8, maxblob ≤ 5
**Geometry quality**: self-intersecting faces 1.4%, fold edges 0.2%, back dihedral median 7.9° (GT decimated to same face count: 10.1°)
**Reference**: DMesh @64v (official code, same exam) 0.9891, 2,400 v / 4,799 f, non-manifold soup

No DMesh anywhere in this chain. Supervision identical to DMesh's: 64 star-camera renders (silhouette+depth+diffuse) of the GT mesh; hull evidence built only from the 64 training silhouettes.

## Reproduction chain (all commits in this repo)
1. `run_64v.py`                       icosphere → C2F growth + v22 despike            → 0.9279  (`cow_armadillo_64v.npz`)
2. `phase1c_pipeline.py` ×2           62 p-gated DLFL extrude carves                  → 0.9572  (`p1d64c` + `_program.json`)
3. `phase1f_hullpull.py` HULL_MODE=vote  voting visual hull field pull (dead zone, anneal) → 0.9841 (`p1f64c`)
4. `phase3d_flip.py` / `phase4_inloop.py`  in-loop DLFL flip + collapse + SI push       → 0.9865  (`p4c_64`)
5. `phase4_inloop.py` SUBDIV_ALL=1 LAP_MULT=3  global DLFL subdivision + same loop      → 0.9914  (`p5_64`)
6. `phase5_taubin.py` ITERS=5         Taubin λ|μ fairing (positions only)             → **0.9957** (`p5_64_taubin5`)

Topology ops are TopMod DLFL only (extrude_face, subdivide_edge, stellate, collapse_edge_tri, delete_edge+insert_edge flips); `check_watertight` asserted after every topology change. Taubin is a standard position-only smoother (Open3D), not part of the operator program.

## Resolution controls (2026-09-02)
| setting | V / F | ho16 | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ours 64v golden | 18,253 / 36,502 | **0.9957** | watertight |
| ours 6v pure, same recipe (subdiv + 6-view hull + in-loop + Taubin) | 20,404 / 40,804 | 0.9555 | train 0.9970 -> overfits 6 views; information-limited, not resolution-limited |
| DMesh 64v default (1000/3000/10000 seeds) | 2,400 / 4,799 | 0.9891 | 75k internal points |
| DMesh 64v hi-res (3000/10000/25000 seeds) | 2,738 / 5,478 | 0.9894 | 190k internal points; output triangles barely grow (existence thresholding), score plateaus |

## Fair face-count comparison vs DMesh (2026-09-02)

DMesh prunes its own faces: epoch_3 starts at 45k (hires) / 188k (dense_b) faces and its
existence-probability optimization removes >85% within 500 steps, even with the real
regularizer set to 0 and reals frozen to 1 every step (`armadillo_64v_dense_{a,b}.yaml`).

| Method | faces | ho16 |
|---|---|---|
| DMesh 64v (default, 14k seeds) | 4.8k | 0.9891 |
| DMesh hires (38k seeds) | 5.5k | 0.9894 |
| DMesh dense_a (no real reg, frozen reals) | 8.1k | 0.9889 |
| DMesh dense_b (dense_a + 98k seeds + ud_thresh 1e-2) | 9.2k | 0.9885 |
| Ours p4c_64 (optimized directly at low res) | 6.3k | 0.9865 |
| Ours golden decimated (quadric) to 5.5k | 5.5k | 0.9921 |
| Ours golden decimated (quadric) to 9.2k | 9.2k | 0.9946 |
| Ours golden | 36.5k | 0.9957 |

Honest reading: at equal LOW resolution optimized directly, DMesh is slightly ahead
(0.9894 vs 0.9865). Our advantage comes from coarse-to-fine (DLFL global subdivision +
in-loop untangle + Taubin) which DMesh cannot do because its representation prunes
itself back to ~5-9k faces regardless of seed count. Figure: dmesh_dense_compare.png.

## Phase 6: resolution ladder (2026-09-02)
| step | V / F | ho16 | SI | back dihedral |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| golden (36.5k) | 18,253 / 36,502 | 0.9957 | 1.4 % | 7.9° |
| + partial DLFL subdiv of 1500 largest faces + in-loop 1200 + Taubin×5 (`p6_50k_taubin5`) | 28,396 / 56,788 | **0.9972** | 0.5 % | 7.3° |
| + global subdiv ×6 (219k f) — ABORTED | 109,508 / 219,012 | (0.9958 before optimizing) | 32 % after 100 steps | — |

Ceiling at 56.8k faces (GT decimated) ≈ 0.999. The 219k run tangled because the mean edge (0.015)
fell below the 256² supervision pixel size (~0.01): per-pixel losses carry no information at that
scale. Effective resolution limit for this recipe ≈ 50–60k faces at 256²; go to 512² images first
to push further. Command: `SUBDIV_TOP=1500 LAP_MULT=3 STEPS=1200 FLIP_EVERY=25 COLLAPSE_EVERY=100
COLLAPSE_RATIO=0.4 COLLAPSE_MAX=800 SI_PUSH=0.15 BASE_NPZ=<golden> phase4_inloop.py` then Taubin×5.

## golden v6.3 (2026-09-26): late-handle reliability + seam refit

Chain = v6.1 stages + three additions (commits be26439, 61c4123, 3cf5df3 + this):

1. **Count-first handle gate (Rule C/C′)** replaces the hard Δho threshold at propose-and-verify:
   accept ⟺ legacy render/hair evidence OR (g<g* AND membrane is genuine air) OR (g<g* AND candidate
   is hull-located). Rescues the thin 4th fertility tunnel that opens with NEGATIVE Δho at Stage 5b
   (render noise floor) — the root cause of v6.1's 13/15. A typed-decision text model (TypeSafe Jev
   paradigm via Laya) was rigorously tried for this decision and measured to be a coin flip at the
   decisive point — negative result archived in GATE_DECISION_findings.md.
2. **Hull-guided completion**: when membrane detection stalls (refined mesh flush to the hull) and
   g<g*, `find_tunnel_by_hull` proposes the handle from the hull's own tunnel location (prov=hull →
   unconditional accept). Plug cache now always stores the COMPLETE g0 set (stale-truncated-cache fix).
3. **Stage 6b, late-handle seam refit** (this entry): a handle opened at 5b misses the Stage-4/5
   polishing and leaves a crack/seam at its mouth (fertility arm). Trigger: genus(p4) ≠ genus(p4g).
   Recipe: one gentle vertex-count-stable refit (STEPS=500, flips on, collapse OFF, LAP×1) + Taubin
   fixed ×5 (AUTO can under-polish). Failed alternatives measured and archived: local Taubin (fades,
   trace remains), positional blending ×3 (transition-band wrinkles), masked-DR via FREEZE_MASK
   (frozen boundary shatters the patch) — the seam needs unconstrained image-evidence refit.
   The 5b handle mids are now archived (handles_<tag>_5b.json) = the seam locations.

| metric | v6.1 | v6.3 |
|---|---|---|
| fertility genus (GT 4, n=15) | 13/15 | **15/15** (rescue fired naturally 4×) |
| fertility seam artifact | crack on arm | **gone** (v62r1: VolIoU 0.9908→0.9915, CD 0.00644→0.00641) |
| per-chain time | ~5.5 min | ~5.8 min normal; +~1 min only on stall runs (~13%) |

phase4_inloop gains an experimental FREEZE_MASK env (per-vertex freeze projection during
optimization; off by default; dropped with a warning if the vertex count changes).

## golden v6.4 (2026-09-30): handle-site validity — supersedes v6.3

**v6.2/v6.3 contained a bug**: hull-guided completion took the first hull plug and the gate accepted
hull-located candidates unconditionally, so a handle could be opened as a BRIDGE through real material
while the genus count still read correct (forced-stall test: genus 4, missing upper tunnel still closed).
The v6.2/v6.3 "15/15" results are withdrawn; the tags are kept for history only.

v6.4 = v6.3 chain + a site check before any count-based rescue (details, math and the measurement
mistakes made on the way: LESSONS_2026-09-29_site_check.md):
- what lies between the two candidate faces: generalized winding number of our mesh (|w|~1 material,
  ~0 air gap, >=1.5 interpenetrating parts; w=-1 is a membrane crushed through itself by DR) and an exact
  per-point silhouette test for hull air (>=2 views see background, 1024 px; no voxel margin);
- MEMBRANE (material in hull air) -> drill; CONTACT (air gap or overlap where the hull is solid, and
  geodesic/straight distance >= 50 so it joins two different parts, not a crease) -> join; else INVALID;
- rejected positions are remembered and never re-proposed; every candidate is logged (sitelog_<tag>.jsonl).

Regression v67 (SEED=0, 64 views):

| shape | runs | genus correct | accepted handles audited vs GT |
|---|---|---|---|
| fertility (g4) | 15 | 15/15 | 60/60 (59 drills on real air, 1 join on real material) |
| threeholes (g3) | 3 | 3/3 | 9/9 |
| kitten (g1) | 3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| rockerarm (g1) | 3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| armadillo (g0) | 3 | 3/3 | no handle opened (correct) |

Site labels of the 75 accepted handles: 73 MEMBRANE, 1 CONTACT, 1 INVALID (a zero-thickness coarse
membrane, kept by the legacy render rule, real per GT). Audit: `audit_sitelog_gt.py` (GT occupancy along
the segment between the two faces). Calibrated on known cases: flags the known bridge, passes the cp6
contact, but falsely flags the GT-verified fx2 contact -> reliable for drills, not yet for joins.
Median chain time 7 min (unchanged). Known limits: geodesic threshold not calibrated on stage-3
mid-round meshes (a true contact at ratio 20 was rejected once and rescued by render evidence); thin
tunnels the visual hull cannot carve; mesh self-intersection is not prevented (combinatorial manifold only).

### 2026-10-01 correction to v6.4 (linking-number audit)

Genus count stands (fertility 15/15 + np1-6 6/6, other shapes 12/12). Strict surface topology (every hull tunnel
realised by a surface handle, `linking_audit.py`): fertility **6/21**. The rest reach genus 4 with a hidden
micro-handle while one tunnel is open only by interpenetration. Table: `results_genus/linking_audit_fertility_v64.txt`;
analysis: `LESSONS_2026-09-29_site_check.md` 7e. v6.4 is therefore NOT golden under the strict criterion.

## golden v6.5 (2026-10-03) - strict surface topology (tag `golden-v6.5`)

Chain = v6.4 + STRICT (default on for synthetic shapes, `STRICT=0` reproduces v6.4):
Stage 5a `strict_repair.py` (remove handles that realise no hull tunnel: non-face 3-cycle, non-separating, zero
linking vector) -> Stage 5b late pass with the near-pair detector, linking-vector prefilter and "tunnels realised
+1" as the only accept rule (no hull face-pair search) -> Stage 6 refine -> Stage 6s re-audit (+ repair if needed)
-> 6b refit -> Taubin. Metric: `linking_audit.py` (rank of the linking matrix between the mesh's H1 generator loops
and one air loop per hull tunnel; GT-free; GT meshes audit 4/4, 3/3, 1/1, 1/1).

| shape (GT genus) | runs | genus right | all tunnels realised | wall (s) | CD | VolIoU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fertility (4) | s6A-C | 3/3 | 3/3 | 482 / 507 / 523 | 0.0063-0.0064 | 0.988-0.992 |
| threeholes (3) | s6A-C | 3/3 | 3/3 | 340 / 341 / 342 | 0.0071 | 0.9914 |
| kitten (1) | s6A-C | 3/3 | 3/3 | 276 / 276 / 299 | 0.0066 | 0.9979 |
| rockerarm (1) | s6A-C | 3/3 | 3/3 | 342 / 279 / 294 | 0.0061 | 0.9870 |
| armadillo (0) | s6A-C | 3/3 | 3/3 | 256 / 254 / 290 | 0.0062 | 0.9948 |

More fertility runs with the final rules: sx1-10 10/10, s5A/C 2/2, s5B 4/4 after Stage 6s (it was 2/4 with damaged
geometry before 6s existed). Tables: `results_genus/linking_audit_strict_s6.txt`,
`linking_audit_fertility_strict_sx.txt`. v6.4 under the same audit: fertility 6/21, other shapes 12/12.
Speed vs v6.4: simple shapes unchanged; fertility median +2.5 min (late pass ~95 s + seam refit ~45 s that v6.4
skipped because a fake handle had filled the count), worst case 25 min -> 8.7 min.
Known limits: fake handles are repaired, not prevented (origin in Stage 3 not understood yet); the cut-and-cap runs
on triangle arrays, not as a DLFL operator; a handle that is redundant but not a 3-cycle cannot be removed (seen
once, s5B; the final audit reports it). Analysis: `LESSONS_2026-09-29_site_check.md` 7e-7h.

## candidate v6.6 (2026-10-06) - thickness-aware coarse subdivision (`THICK_SUBDIV=1`, not yet default)

Thin walls: the coarse mesh is refined where the visual hull is thinner than the edge, before the sides can interpenetrate
(LESSONS 7k). Memory/time fixes that came with it: sparse tube_mask, local-submesh despike surgery (Stage 4 81 min -> minutes),
chain aborts on a missing stage output.
